For complete beginners:
Use an IDE to compile this code into a dll. I recommend Visual Studio 2019 Community. Its free and widely used.
Open the .sln (solution) file with the IDE program. This file is just to build the dll.
Next open AH6.cpp and the .h files to edit them to your needs. The .cpp file contains all the available functions from DCS and the .h files are to help separate and organize systems.
To create the .dll file, click Build>Build Solution or right click the project in the solution explorer.
